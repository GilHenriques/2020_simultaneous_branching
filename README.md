# Code for simultaneous branching project

This repository contains the code to generate data and to generate the figures for the simultaneous branching project.

## Code to generate data

Code to generate OSS, IBS, and PDE simulations can be found in the figure `code_for_submission`

## Analysing data and generating figures

The other folders contain R code to analyse data and create figures.

Raw data files generated from OSS simulations are included as `RDS` files.
Raw data files generated frm IBS and PDE are not included because they are too large, but they can be generated by running the code in `code_for_submission`. 
The repository includes the IBS summary data generated from the raw data, in the form of `RDS` files, as well as the `R` files used to generate summary data.
I also included all `R` code necessary to generate figures from summary data (in the IBS case) or from raw data (in the OSS/PDE case).
